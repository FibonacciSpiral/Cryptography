The Central Fire Station is a historic fire station at 399 Main Street in Falmouth, Massachusetts. The two storey brick building was built in 1929 to a design by Fitchburg architects Haynes & Mason. The brick is laid in Flemish bond, and there are wooden quoins at the corners. The central doorway is flanked by pilasters, and is topped by a fanlight. The flat roof is hidden from view by a low parapet. To the left of the doorway is the main truck bay, and to its right is a group of five sash windows. Both the truck bay and window group are topped by matching low arched finish with keystone.[2]The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998.
