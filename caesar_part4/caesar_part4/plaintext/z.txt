The Gavarnie Falls (French: Grande Cascade de Gavarnie) is a tiered waterfall in France. With its overall drop of 422 metres, it is the highest waterfall in mainland France.[citation needed] The falls are situated in the Cirque de Gavarnie, near the village Gavarnie in the Hautes-Pyrénées.The waterfall is the beginning of the Gave de Pau stream. It is fed by a melting snow and a small glacier, located in Spain. This water seeps underground until it appears at the upper rim of waterfall. The average annual flow in the waterfall is 3 m3/s. In summer, when the snowmelt is most intense, it can reach up to 200 m3/s.[1] In winter it sometimes freezes and stops flowing.The waterfall has 2 - 3 steps; the height of the tallest drop is 281 m.
